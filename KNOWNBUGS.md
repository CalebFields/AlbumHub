# Ranker Tab
Ranker game is definitely bugged, planning on fixing it in the next update.

# Filters
Filters may be behaving strangely in some contexts, needs further investigation

# Graphics
Need to handle rendering more robustly and avoid flashing everytime the view changes, also scrolling render issues

# API
Need to rework API requests to be faster, currently processing files at slower than  2 seconds per file when the theoretical fastest is 1 second
